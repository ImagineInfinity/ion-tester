# Ion-tester #
Made to help learning ions.
## A note on learning ##
This project does not do what it was supposed to.
### How the brain chooses what to store more
- Things that happened first
- Things that were more recent
- Suprising things
- Things with a suprising impact
- Repitition (This is what was attempted in this project)

A problem with this project is that it does more harm than good. If you wish to learn the ions, do it naturally - by doing a lot of problems. The ions that turn up more frequently, you will remember; but the ones that turn up less, you don't need to.

* "Limit ions": choose which ions you want to learn
* "No need for upper case": toggle case sensitivity
* "Restart on check": after pressing checking, A new round will start
* "start": start a new round
* "check": check if you have answered correctly. Same as pressing "enter" on your keyboard.

This doesn't have any input, and instead works as flash cards.
